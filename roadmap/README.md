# Ason Codebase Improvement Roadmap

This directory contains the detailed implementation roadmap for improving the Ason codebase based on the comprehensive code review. The plan is organized into phases with individual Units of Work (UOW) that can be implemented independently.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase Priority
1. **Phase 1 (Security)**: Critical - Must be completed first
2. **Phase 2 (Quality)**: High - Foundation for future work
3. **Phase 3 (Performance)**: Medium - User experience improvements
4. **Phase 4 (Architecture)**: Medium - Long-term maintainability
5. **Phase 5 (Testing)**: Medium - Ongoing quality assurance

### Dependencies
- Phase 1 has no dependencies - can start immediately
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 completion
- Phase 3 can start after Phase 2 UOW-004 (global state removal)
- Phase 4 can start after Phase 2 completion
- Phase 5 can run in parallel with other phases

## Success Metrics

- **Security**: 0 critical/high vulnerabilities
- **Quality**: All tests passing, comprehensive documentation
- **Performance**: >30% improvement in large template processing
- **Architecture**: Plugin system functional, centralized config
- **Testing**: >85% test coverage across all packages

## Getting Started

1. Review the UOW documents in phase1-security/
2. Implement UOWs in numerical order within each phase
3. Mark UOWs as complete when all acceptance criteria are met
4. Update this README with progress tracking
