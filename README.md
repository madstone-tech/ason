# â€» Ason - Shake Your Projects Into Being

> *The sacred rattle that transforms templates into living code*

A powerful, lightweight project scaffolding tool that catalyzes the transformation of templates into fully-formed projects. Built with Go's simplicity and minimal dependencies.

## Quick Start

### Using Pre-built Binaries
```bash
# Download latest release
curl -sL https://github.com/madstone-tech/ason/releases/latest/download/ason_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv ason /usr/local/bin/

# Or install with Go
go install github.com/madstone-tech/ason@latest
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/madstone-tech/ason.git
cd ason

# Using Taskfile (recommended)
task setup           # Setup development environment
task build           # Build the binary
task                 # Show all available tasks

# Or using traditional tools
go mod tidy
go build -o ason .
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run the CLI
./ason --help

# Create a project
./ason new ./my-template my-project
```

## Features

- ðŸª‡ **Rhythmic Generation**: Fast, lightweight operation with minimal dependencies
- ðŸŽ­ **Jinja2-like Templating**: Uses Pongo2 for familiar template syntax
- ðŸ“¿ **Template Registry**: Local management of your template collection
- ðŸ’« **Interactive Prompts**: Beautiful terminal UI with Bubble Tea
- ðŸ”® **Terraform Integration**: Seamless infrastructure-as-code support
- âš¡ **Shell Autocompletion**: Tab completion for bash, zsh, and fish

## Shell Autocompletion

Ason supports autocompletion for bash, zsh, and fish shells, providing intelligent suggestions for:

- Template names from your registry
- File and directory paths
- Command flags and options
- Variable names (name=, version=, etc.)

### Quick Installation

```bash
# Install completion for your current shell
./scripts/install-completion.sh

# Or install for specific shells
./scripts/install-completion.sh bash zsh fish

# Or install for all available shells
./scripts/install-completion.sh all
```

### Manual Installation

#### Bash
```bash
# Generate completion script
ason completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/ason

# Or for system-wide installation (requires sudo)
sudo ason completion bash > /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/ason
```

#### Zsh

**For Oh My Zsh users (recommended):**
```bash
# Create custom plugin
mkdir -p ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/ason
ason completion zsh > ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/ason/_ason

# Add to plugins list in ~/.zshrc
# plugins=(... ason)
```

**Alternative for Oh My Zsh:**
```bash
# Direct to completions directory (if it exists)
ason completion zsh > ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_ason
```

**For standard Zsh setup:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.zfunc
ason completion zsh > ~/.zfunc/_ason

# Add to ~/.zshrc if not already present
echo 'fpath=(~/.zfunc $fpath)' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'autoload -U compinit' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'compinit' >> ~/.zshrc
```

#### Fish
```bash
# Install fish completion
ason completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/ason.fish
```

### Testing Completion

After installation, test completion by typing:
```bash
ason <TAB>          # Shows available commands
ason new <TAB>      # Shows available templates and directories
ason remove <TAB>   # Shows templates in registry
ason --<TAB>        # Shows available flags
```

## Building and Releasing

This project uses [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev) for automation and [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com) for building and releasing.

### Development Tasks

```bash
# Install Task (if not already installed)
go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest

# Show all available tasks
task

# Setup and installation
task setup              # Complete development environment setup
task install            # Install binary to GOPATH/bin
task uninstall          # Remove binary from GOPATH/bin

# Common development tasks
task build              # Build for current platform
task test               # Run tests
task test:coverage      # Run tests with coverage
task lint               # Run linters
task clean              # Clean build artifacts
```

### Building for Multiple Platforms

```bash
# Build for all platforms (local, no publish)
task release:local

# Create snapshot release (test release process)
task release:snapshot

# Test release process (dry run)
task release:test
```

### Creating Releases

```bash
# Create and push a git tag
task git:tag TAG=v1.0.0

# Publish release (requires GITHUB_TOKEN)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
task release:publish
```

### Package Managers

The release process automatically creates packages for:
- **Homebrew** (macOS): `brew install madstone-tech/tap/ason`
- **APK** (Alpine Linux)
- **DEB** (Debian/Ubuntu)
- **RPM** (RedHat/CentOS)
- **AUR** (Arch Linux)
- **Docker**: `docker pull ghcr.io/madstone-tech/ason:latest`

## About the Name

Ason is named after the sacred rattle used in Haitian Vodou ceremonies - a tool that catalyzes transformation and invokes change. Just as the ason's rhythm activates spiritual work, this tool activates the transformation of templates into living projects.
